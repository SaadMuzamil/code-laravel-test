Approach and Optimization Explanation

Approach:

1. Eloquent Models and Relationships:


   -Models Setup: Defined Eloquent models for `Customer`, `Order`, and `Item` with appropriate relationships. This setup leverages Laravel’s querying capabilities and ensures manageable and logical data retrieval.


   -Search Scope: Implemented a `scopeSearch` method in the `Customer` model to handle search logic. This method facilitates searching across multiple related models (`cutomers` , `orders` and `items`) in a flexible and reusable manner.

2. Controller Logic:
   - Search Handling: In the `CustomerController`, used the `search` scope to build a query based on user input. The search criteria are applied to the `Customer` model, with related `orders` and `items` eagerly loaded to optimize data fetching.
   - Pagination: Applied `paginate(10)` to limit results per page, managing large datasets efficiently and reducing server and client load by only loading a subset of results.

3. Routes and Middleware:
   - Middleware: Implemented input sanitization middleware to ensure clean and safe search inputs. This enhances security by preventing XSS and other potential injection attacks.
   - Routes: Defined a route for the customer listing that uses the `CustomerController` and applies the sanitization middleware.

4. Blade Template:
   - Dynamic Data Rendering: Utilized a Blade template to dynamically display customer data. The template includes a search form, a results table, and pagination links for navigating through results.

Optimization Techniques:

1. Eager Loading:
   - revents N+1 Query Problem: Used `with(['orders.items'])` to fetch related `orders` and `items` in a single query, avoiding multiple queries for each customer and significantly improving performance with large datasets.

2. Efficient Querying:
   - Search Scope: The `scopeSearch` method constructs a single query incorporating searches across `email`, `orders`, and `items`. Using `orWhereHas` filters related models efficiently, reducing search logic complexity and database queries.

3.Pagination:
   - Manage Large Datasets: Laravel’s pagination fetches and displays only a subset of results at a time, preventing excessive data loading and maintaining application responsiveness with large records.

4. Input Sanitization:
   - Security: The `sanitizeInput` middleware cleans all user inputs before processing, crucial for application security and preventing common vulnerabilities.

5. Database Indexing (Assumed):
   - indexes on Columns: Assumed appropriate indexes on `email`, `order_number`, and `item name` columns. Indexes enhance search query speed and overall performance by reducing search times.

This approach ensures that the search functionality is efficient and secure, addressing performance and scalability while maintaining code clarity and ease of maintenance.

Factory and Seeder Examples

- Customer Factory: Generates random customer data for testing.
- Order Factory: Creates orders associated with customers.
- Item Factory: Produces items linked to orders.
- Customer Seeder: Seeds the database with sample customers.
- Order Seeder: Seeds orders for each customer.
- Item Seeder: Seeds items for each order.

These components help populate your database with test data and verify the correct operation of search functionality and relationships.
